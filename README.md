This repository contains a collection of Objective-C categories I normally use in my projects.
### **NSString+filename** 
A collection of methods to encode/decode a string so that can be stored in any MAC OS X filesystem. 
### **NSManagedObject+toDictionary** 
A convenient method to convert an NSManagedObject to a NSDictionary with all the attributes and relationships.
